		This is my own personal website to document my finished projects, interests, plans, and my half-finished, dust gathering projects that may someday be completed.
		This also serves as somewhat of a portfolio, so enjoy poking around!<br />
		<br />
		The "Projects" section is a gallery of my completed projects with a description and links to the project itself or just more info.<br />
		The "Bits & Ends" section is a blog that also contains my smaller projects (either completed or not completed)!<br />
