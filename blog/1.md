Recently I uncovered a side-project of mine that I creatively titled [PianoPractice][piano-practice]. PianoPractice is a nifty little web app that teaches you how to play the piano. It is far from complete, but I hope to give it a large and useful feature set.

When I started coding, I noticed a **big** problem: my Soundfonts were almost *never* loading. Looking in the Firefox Debug console unveiled this error message:  
```Unhandled Exception (in DOM Promise): The audio buffer passed to decodeAudio contained invalid data and could not be processed.```  
Huh, ok, so maybe a corrupt audio file? Well that could be the case for one audio file, but *all* ~50 sounds were failing to load! And no sound means no piano.

To add to the confusion, this error did not always happen. Rarely all the sounds would load and I could play piano. Other times the error would get thrown 2-4 times, yet enough sounds loaded for me to play piano.

After Googling for a while, I figured out nothing. No one else seems to be getting this error, and any bug report to [MIDI JS][midi-js] would simply go unanswered. So I began diving into debugging.
To start, I took a look at the lines causing the issue. [MIDI JS][midi-js] is a complex library, but within its `loader.js` file, the following function was creating the error:
```
function loadAudio(url, onload, onerror) {
	if (useStreamingBuffer) {
		var audio = new Audio();
		audio.src = url;
		audio.controls = false;
		audio.autoplay = false;
		audio.preload = false;
		audio.addEventListener('canplay', function() {
			onload && onload(audio);
		});
		audio.addEventListener('error', function(err) {
			onerror && onerror(err);
		});
		document.body.appendChild(audio);
	} else if (url.indexOf('data:audio') === 0) { // Base64 string
		    var base64 = url.split(',')[1];
		    var buffer = Base64Binary.decodeArrayBuffer(base64);
		    ctx.decodeAudioData(buffer, onload, onerror); // !!! ERROR IS HERE !!!
	} else { // XMLHTTP buffer
		var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
		request.open('GET', url, true);
		request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
		request.onload = function() {
			ctx.decodeAudioData(request.response, onload, onerror);
		};
		request.send();
	}
}
```

It's pretty straightforward code; it uses a Base64 encoded string `url` to store each audio file (one audio file per piano note). Each Base64 string is decoded into an `ArrayBuffer` and sent to WebAudio's `decodeAudioData()` to be decoded into an OGG sound that the browser can play.
Base64 is great, but sometimes I feel like it can be abused. For example, MIDI JS encoded all **83 OGG files** into Base64 and shoved them into one [JavaScript file][base64-horror]! This makes the JavaScript file for that soundfont a whopping 1.4MB! So yeah, that takes a while to load.  

Not only does it take a while to load, but it'll take a while to decode into audio samples. MIDI JS parallelizes this process by using WebAudio's `decodeAudioData()` promise mechanism. Any modern web developer would say yes, that's what you're supposed to do. And yes, you truely are supposed to do that, but let's take a moment to think about what may be causing our error.

 1. Load massive 1.4MB JavaScript file
 2. Decode 1.4MB of Base64 strings
 3. Shove ~1.4MB of `ArrayBuffer` into the WebAudio API to decode, all at once
 4. Wait for all the samples to finish decoding

Step 4 almost never happens, because step 3 returns almost immediately with the previous error. Further debugging proved that steps 1 and 2 always occur, so the problem had to be in step 3.
For some reason, the WebAudio API was throwing an error before decoding the data. Because of the randomness of this bug, I decided to rewrite the sound loading algorithm to not decode the audio samples in parallel.

After a few minutes, I came up with a patched version of the code that loaded the sounds one-by-one:
```
/// Below is their old function that decodes the sounds in parallel
var requestAudio = function(soundfont, instrumentId, index, key) {
	var url = soundfont[key];
	if (url) {
		bufferPending[instrumentId] ++;
		loadAudio(url, function(buffer) {
			buffer.id = key;
			var noteId = root.keyToNote[key];
			audioBuffers[instrumentId + '' + noteId] = buffer;
			///
			if (-- bufferPending[instrumentId] === 0) {
				var percent = index / 87;
// 							console.log(MIDI.GM.byId[instrumentId], 'processing: ', percent);
				soundfont.isLoaded = true;
				waitForEnd(instrument);
			}
			else {
			    
			}
		}, function(err) {
 				console.log(err);
		});
	}
};
/// Below is my new function that decodes samples one-by-one
var customRequestAudio = function(soundfont, instrumentId, index) {
    var key = urls[index];			
	var url = soundfont[key];
	if (url) {
		loadAudio(url, function(buffer) {
			buffer.id = key;
			var noteId = root.keyToNote[key];
			audioBuffers[instrumentId + '' + noteId] = buffer;
			if (-- bufferPending[instrumentId] === 0) {
				var percent = index / 87;
				soundfont.isLoaded = true;
				waitForEnd(instrument);
			}
			else {
			    customRequestAudio(soundfont, instrumentId, index+1);
			}
		}, function(err) {
 				console.log(err);
		});
	}
};
```
And it worked! I tried reloading multiple times, closing FireFox and reopening, and also restarting my machine. It still worked! The randomly occurring bug was no longer occurring! Yes, my load
time was increased significantly, but at least it would load successfully.

The lesson to be learned here: Don't shove 1.4MB of audio data into FireFox's WebAudio at once and expect it to work all the time.
