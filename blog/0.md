# First Post
Yay! This is the first blog post I've made on this website.

I'm using Showndown JS to convert this Markdown file to the HTML you are viewing now, which allows me to make posts a lot faster and not have to create ALLLLLLL that HTML boilerplate over and over again.
Additionally, this lets me use nifty tricks with Axios and Vue.

Test to see if *code highlighting* is working:

```python
def main():
	print("Hello World!")
```
