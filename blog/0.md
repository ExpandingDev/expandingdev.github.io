Hello World!

This is the *first* post that I am putting onto my new Github Pages/Blog/Thing, so I thought it would be appropriate to introduce myself.

Currently (as of 2020), I am a student studying Computer Engineering at Penn State. I created this website on a whim, and got absolutely no homework done in the meantime. In the end, there is a good chance that me taking the time to create a portfolio website will be more benefitial than **any** amount of Python code I write for class.

Things that I will be sharing on this website:
- Random coding tips I find
- Introductions and usage examples of code I create
- Opinions about new tech standards & languages
